# fight_arena
in C++ language



this project demonstrate the arena where fight two characters one of them is archer and second is warrior. Archer have a unique bow and knife which have specific damage which u can find in data.csv and even edit it. With the same parameters is set axe that has a warrior. The fight is in the fight_log.csv file where is wrote each damage taken from each person in the arena and as luck would have there are filing data like how many arrows remain archer and how far is warrior from archer. Hope that my first c++ project is not worst and can improve yours knowledge.
