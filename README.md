# fight_arena
in C++ language


this project demonstrate the arena where fight two characters one of them is archer asn second is warrior. Archer have a uniq bow and knife which have specific damage which u can find in data.csv file and with the same parameters is sat in class axe what has a warrior. The fight is in the fight_log file where is wrote each damage from each person in the arena and as luck would have it there are filing data like how many arrows remain archer and how far is warrior from archer. Hope that my first c++ project is not worst and can improve yours knowledge about this programing language. Enjoy
