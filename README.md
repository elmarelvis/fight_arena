# fight_arena
in C++ language


This project demonstrate arena where fight two characters one of them is archer and second is warrior. Archer have a unique bow and knife which have specific damage which we can find in data.csv and even edit it. With the same parameters is set axe which belongs warrior. The fight is in the fight_log.csv file where is written each damage taken from each person in the arena also there are fill data like how many arrows remain archer and how far is warrior from archer. Hope that my first c++ project is interesting for you and I would like to see your opinion about it.
